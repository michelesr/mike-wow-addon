Mike WoW Addon
================
Welcome to Mike's WoW Addon documentation. 

Introduction
============

Everything started when i wanted to write some macro for the game.

As soon as i started i noticed some bad things about ingame macro/scripting interface, such as:

- limit of 255 characters in macro or scripts
- macro editor is limited in features (is not suitable for developing)
- limit of 255 characters make you write unclear code
- some main feature like /castsequence not implemented in vanilla

So i dediced to make an addon where i put all my script embedded in slash commands, and also provide a simple command line interface to write some generic macro.

I hope you can find it useful, and if you need some information or wanna requests some feature feel free to write me at mikefender@cryptolab.net.

Feel free to help adding or improving features.

That's all folks, enjoy!
