Mike WoW Addon
================
Welcome to Mike's WoW Addon documentation. 

Introduction
============

Everything started when i wanted to write some macro for the game.

As soon as i started doing that i noticed some limits of wow interface, such as:

- limit of 255 characters in macro
- i don't like wow ingame macro editor
- limit of 255 characters make you write unclear code

So i dediced to make an addon where i put all my script embedeed in slash commands, and also provide a simple interface to write some generic macro.

I must admit that is more a collection of scripts then a real addon with graphical user interface, but i had to do that because was the only way to do what i was looking for, and I'm satisfied of the result.

I hope you can find it useful, if you need some information or wanna requests some feature feel free to write me at mikefender@cryptolab.net .

Also this is free software, released under the GNU GPL License Version 3, and source code is on github at https://github.com/michelesr/mike-wow-addon, so feel free do help adding or improving features.

That's all folks, enjoy!
