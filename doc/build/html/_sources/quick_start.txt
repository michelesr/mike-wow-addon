Getting Started
***************

The first thing to do after installation is see if the addon is loaded by World of Warcraft. In the Character Selection screen open the AddOn panel and check "Mike's Addon" to enable it. 

After login, you will be able to use slash command /mike or /mi to see the options aviable for the addon.

.. note:: in every command reference and example i use the extended command (/mike) instead of /mi, but you can use /mi too to abbreviate commands.

If you use an option more times and you need to use in real time you should bind it to a Macro and then to a key binding, and in particular, you should do that for commands from "Macro Framework" and "Premade Macro Commands" section.

The "Premade Macro Commands" section is not so populated, because:

- you can find all you need for writing macro in "Macro Framework"
- i'll add "premade" commands in there only if people ask to me

Binding to a macro
==================

Open the Macro panel, create a new Macro giving a name and an Icon. Then insert the command (example: /mike heal 75 Lesser Heal) in the macro text box and you're ready to go.

Binding to an hotkey
====================

In order to bind it to a hotkey you must create a macro first, then put in a action bar button, and then assing a hotkey for that button using "Key Bindings" panel.

Check out this documentation
============================

The ingame help is only a command reference, so i suggest you to check out Documentation, and in particular, "Macro Framework" if you wanna start writing some smart macro.
