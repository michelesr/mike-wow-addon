Sharing quests objectives
=========================

You can share your quests objectives in your party chat in 2 ways.

To share objectives for common quests in party ::

	/mike qshare

..

NOTE: there's a limit for max chat messages per seconds, so if you have too many quests some will not be shared.

To share quest objectives for selected quest ::

	/mike qss

..

NOTE: this will share the quest that is selected (highlighted) in the quest log.
