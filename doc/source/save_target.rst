Save & Restore Target
=====================

This functions are used to save a particular target to restore that later.

**NOTE**: target save is based on names, so will work good only with unique names, such as unique NPC (including rare and boss mobs) and players.

To save target ::

	/mike tsave

..

To restore target ::

	/mike trestore

..

To save a custom target name ::

	/mike tcustom <name>

..

**HINT**: you can use this if you're searching for a rare mob, save his <name> and then use /mi restore to target him.
