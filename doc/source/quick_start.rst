Getting Started
===============

The first thing to do after installation is see if the addon is loaded by World of Warcraft. In the Character Selection screen open the AddOn panel and check "Mike's Addon" to enable it. 

After login, you will be able to use slash command /mike or /mi to see the options aviable for the addon.

If you use an option more times and you need to use in real time you should bind it to a Macro and then to a key binding. 

Binding to a macro
==================

Open the Macro panel, create a new Macro giving a name and an Icon. Then insert the command (example: /mike heal 75 Lesser Heal) in the macro text box and you're ready to go.

Binding to an hotkey
====================

In order to bind it to a hotkey you must create a macro first, then put in a action bar button, and then assing a hotkey for that button using "Key Bindings" panel.
